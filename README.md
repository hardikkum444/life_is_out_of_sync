# Differences Between Async Programming and Multithreading

| Feature                | Async Programming                          | Multithreading                          |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Execution Model**    | Single-threaded event loop                | Multiple threads running concurrently   |
| **Overhead**           | Lower overhead, lightweight                | Higher overhead due to context switching |
| **Use Cases**          | Best for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., network requests) | Best for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., heavy computations) |
| **Complexity**         | Simpler to reason about, avoids callback hell | More complex due to synchronization issues |
| **Control Flow**       | Uses `async` and `await` for non-blocking execution | Threads run independently, can lead to race conditions |
| **Resource Management**| Efficient resource usage, can handle many tasks with fewer resources | Requires careful management of shared resources |
| **Error Handling**     | Errors can be caught using try/catch in async functions | Requires careful handling to avoid crashes due to thread issues |
